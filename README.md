Roboflight is a programming game planned as a spiritual successor to robocode. The name might change once it gets further along.

This is the second draft of roboflight. Everything is up in the air at this point.

The concept is to have Robot in 3D space fight it out, without any human interaction beyond programming.

- Allow loading of robots from jars
- Add some kind of delay between missile launches.
- Individual robot coloring for robot, missile and bullets (perhaps thrust as well).

- Add restart option
- Move current debug options into a menu/dialog.
- Add robot debug print support to UI.

MILESTONE 3
- Allow missiles to be armed, disarmed programmatic
  - Perhpas allow unarmed missiles to remain undetected and move slowly?
