=Roboflight=
This is a programming game planned as a spiritual successor to robocode. A new name is pending review.

This is the second draft of this program, and still very much in Alpha. All choices are subject to change.

=Concept=
The concept is to have two or more Robots in 3D space fight it out, without any human interaction beyond what they programmed the robot to do.
