Roboflight is a programming game planned as a spiritual successor to robocode. The name might change once it gets further along.

This is the second draft of roboflight. Everything is up in the air at this point.

The concept is to have Robot in 3D space fight it out, without any human interaction beyond programming.

~~MILESTONE 1~~
- [x] Create a simple battle starter
  - [x] Loading of robots from classes
- [x] Add support for multiple robots of the same type to not share static data I think anyway
- [x] Get missiles working again
- [x] All those misc events... (on death, on other death, on hit by, on hit with, ...)
- [x] Retweak UI to display energy in a nicer way.
  - [x] Add UI support for more then two combatants while I am at it.
- [x] Add pause/stop options
- [x] Add FPS slider
- [x] Add Non Interface Base Class
