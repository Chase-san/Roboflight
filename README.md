Roboflight is a programming game planned as a spiritual successor to robocode. The name might change once it gets further along.

This is the second draft of roboflight. Everything is up in the air at this point.

The concept is to have Robot in 3D space fight it out, without any human interaction beyond programming.

~~MILESTONE 1~~
- ~~Create a simple battle starter~~
  - ~~Loading of robots from classes~~
- ~~Add support for multiple robots of the same type to not share static data I think anyway~~
- ~~Get missiles working again~~
- ~~All those misc events... (on death, on other death, on hit by, on hit with, ...)~~
- ~~Retweak UI to display energy in a nicer way.~~
  - ~~Add UI support for more then two combatants while I am at it.~~
- ~~Add pause/stop options~~
- ~~Add FPS slider~~
- ~~Add Non Interface Base Class~~

MILESTONE 2
- Allow loading of robots from jars
- Add some kind of delay between missile launches.
- Individual robot coloring for robot, missile and bullets (perhaps thrust as well).
- Add Robot/Robot collisions
- Add Missile/Bullet collisions
- Add restart option
- Move current debug options into a menu/dialog.
- Add robot debug print support to UI.
- Add the ability to save options.
- Add security manager.
- Add missing collision events (wall, missile, robot, etc)

MILESTONE 3
- Allow missiles to be armed, disarmed programmatic
  - Perhpas allow unarmed missiles to remain undetected and move slowly?
- Battle winning
- Multiple Rounds
- Battle Scoring
- ???
