# Roboflight

This is a programming game planned as a spiritual successor to robocode. A new name is pending review.

This is the second draft of this program, and still very much in Alpha. All choices are subject to change.

## Concept

The concept is to have two or more Robots in 3D space fight it out, without any human interaction beyond what they programmed the robot to do.

## Licenses

The code is licensed under the incredibly permissive ZLIB license. The sample robots are public domain (unlicensed, waived all rights, etc).

But the basic rundown is that you can do about whatever you want, so long as you don't try and hold me liable. The zlib just has the extra clause that you can't claim you wrote it, and it would be nice if you mentioned me in the credits.
